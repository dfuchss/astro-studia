Written between 54 and 51 BC and cast as a dialogue set a lifetime earlier, in
129 BC. Scipio Aemilianus and his circle spend three days arguing about what
holds a state together, and the answer Cicero puts in Scipio's mouth is that no
simple constitution does.

## The argument

Monarchy, aristocracy and democracy each have a virtue the others lack, and each
decays into a characteristic vice — tyranny, oligarchy, mob rule. Left alone,
every simple constitution runs through that cycle. A constitution that combines
all three sets each against the others, and the resulting balance is what
survives.

The claim is not original to Cicero — Polybius had made it about Rome a century
before — but the form is. He is arguing that the Roman republic was not designed
and did not need to be: it accumulated.

> Our constitution was not the work of one man's genius but of many, and not of
> one lifetime but of several ages and generations.

## What survives

Most of the six books are lost. Book VI survives separately as the _Somnium
Scipionis_, preserved because Macrobius wrote a commentary on it, and about a
third of the rest was recovered in 1819 from a palimpsest in the Vatican Library
— the text had been scraped off and written over with Augustine on the Psalms.

That recovery is why this page can cite a 1928 edition of a work from 51 BC.

The gap in the right-hand column is not a printing error. It is a passage the
scraping took and the recovery did not give back, and the convention is to show
it rather than to guess.
