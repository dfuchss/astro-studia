/**
 * The feature manifest: what this template is made of, and what belongs to
 * what. It is prose plus structure, and it has three consumers that cannot
 * disagree:
 *
 *   src/features.ts       the flags themselves, generated from this list
 *   scripts/gen-docs.mjs  writes that generated region, and the docs table
 *   scripts/init.mjs      sets the flags from a preset or a selection
 *
 * If you add a feature to this template, add it here and run `npm run docs`;
 * everything else follows. Nothing here deletes anything — a feature is off
 * when its flag is false, and its code stays on disk, type-checked.
 *
 * A preset is a STARTING SELECTION, not a mode: init pre-ticks its features
 * and you tick and untick freely, before or after.
 *
 * `profile`  one person: publications, a CV, a blog, software, a GitHub list.
 * `project`  a project or group: sub-projects, paper pages, a team.
