# Deploying

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push and pull request to `main`:
install, `prettier --check`, `astro check`, `docs:check`, `build`, `verify`, then
publish `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch — the last step only on a non-PR push to
`main`.

A second workflow, `docs.yml`, copies `docs/` into the repository's wiki. It
needs one secret and one thing done by hand first — see
[Publishing the docs to the wiki](#publishing-the-docs-to-the-wiki) at the
bottom.

Verify runs **before** the publish. That ordering is the entire point: a
broken link or a changed PDF fails the workflow instead of reaching the site.

## GitHub Pages

1. Settings → Pages → deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.
2. Set `SITE.url` in `src/consts.ts`. `astro.config.ts` and
   `src/pages/robots.txt.ts` both read it, so that is the only place it is
   written down.
3. For a custom domain, add `public/CNAME` containing the bare hostname.

`public/.nojekyll` is already there and must stay. Without it Pages runs Jekyll
over the output, and Jekyll ignores directories beginning with an underscore —
which is where Astro puts every hashed asset. The failure mode is a live site
with no CSS, so `verify` checks for it.

`verify` also checks that `dist/CNAME` exists whenever `public/CNAME` does. The
deploy replaces the branch wholesale, so a CNAME that stops being emitted is a
domain that stops resolving, and nothing else would notice.

### A project page rather than a domain

Deploying to `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` needs a base path. Two edits:

```js
// astro.config.ts
base: '/my-repo',
```

```ts
// src/consts.ts
url: 'https://<user>.github.io/my-repo',
```

That is genuinely all, but it is worth knowing why, because Astro's own
documentation warns that it is not:

> When using this option, all of your static asset imports and URLs should add
> the base as a prefix.

Astro prefixes the URLs it generates itself — hashed assets, imported images —
but not a `/cv/` you wrote by hand, and it will not guess: given `/something`
it cannot tell whether you meant it relative to the base or to the server root.
There is no built-in option that changes this.

The usual workaround is a `withBase()` helper called everywhere a path is
emitted. This template does not use one, because that approach cannot reach
the cases that break most often — an image path in `people.yml`, a slides link
in a paper's front matter, a plain `![](/assets/…)` in a post. Those are
strings in content, not expressions in a component.

Instead `src/integrations/base-paths.ts` rewrites the built output once, at
the end of the build. You write `/cv/` everywhere, and it is correct at the
root and in a subdirectory alike. (Starlight's ecosystem arrived at the same
answer for the same reason.) It is a no-op when no base is set.

`npm run verify` then proves it worked: with a base configured, any internal
link or subresource that does not carry it fails the build. So this cannot
regress quietly into a site whose every link is broken.

**The one case it cannot reach** is a client-side script that builds a path at
runtime. There is one, in `src/pages/blog/index.astro`; it reads
`import.meta.env.BASE_URL` directly. Do the same if you add another.

**A note on `robots.txt`.** Crawlers only read `/robots.txt` at the origin
root, so on a project page yours is at a path nothing will fetch. That is a
property of GitHub Pages, not of this template — the `sitemap-index.xml` URL
in it is still correct, and submitting the sitemap directly to Search Console
works regardless.

## Serving your own 404

GitHub Pages serves `/404.html` for a miss automatically, so nothing is needed
there. Other hosts do not: Apache hands a miss to whatever `ErrorDocument` says,
which by default is the hosting panel's generic page rather than yours. Put this
in `public/.htaccess` and it is copied into the build verbatim:

```apache
ErrorDocument 404 /404.html
```

`ErrorDocument` needs `AllowOverride FileInfo`, so check that is on before
assuming it worked — a silently ignored directive looks exactly like a working
one until someone mistypes a URL.

## Another host

Nothing here needs GitHub. The build is a directory of static files with no
server-side anything.

Under the default URL policy every route is `<route>/index.html`, which every
static host serves correctly without configuration. Point the host at `dist/`
— or, as fuchss.org does, have a web server pull the `gh-pages` branch.

## The URL policy

`URL_POLICY` in `src/lib/paths.ts` is the one place this is decided, and it
has two values:

- **`'directory'`** (the default): every page is `<route>/index.html` and
  every URL ends in a slash — `/papers/de-officiis/`. This is Astro's
  `trailingSlash: 'always'` with `build.format: 'directory'`.
- **`'preserve'`**: a page's file mirrors its source file. Every route in this
  template is an `index.astro` in a directory and keeps its slash — except
  the paper pages, which are `src/pages/papers/[slug].astro` and so become
  flat files published as `/papers/de-officiis`, no slash, no extension.
  This is `trailingSlash: 'ignore'` with `build.format: 'preserve'`.

The second exists for a site that cannot move. ardoco.de published its paper
pages as `/c/icse25` for years; they are indexed, cited and linked that way,
and a template that could only emit `/c/icse25/` would be asking it to break
every one of those links. Flip the constant and nothing else needs an edit:

- `astro.config.ts` derives both Astro settings from it.
- `paperPath()` is the one link helper whose shape differs.
- `routePath()` turns `Astro.url.pathname` — which under `'preserve'` is the
  **file** path, `/papers/de-officiis.html` — back into the address, for the
  canonical link, `og:url` and the Scholar/JSON-LD URLs. Only `BaseHead.astro`
  and `ScholarMeta.astro` build a page URL, and both go through it.
- `src/pages/feed.xml.ts` emits every item link as a full URL, because
  `@astrojs/rss` re-shapes a relative one: its `trailingSlash` option appends
  a slash to every link by default and strips one from every link when false,
  and a feed that can carry both blog posts and flat paper pages needs
  neither. ardoco.de shipped that bug — every link in its feed 404ed.
- `src/integrations/sitemap-shape.ts` rewrites each sitemap entry to the file
  that was actually emitted, because `@astrojs/sitemap` keys its trailing
  slash on `build.format === 'directory'` and under `'preserve'` publishes
  `/people` for a page that is `people/index.html`.

`npm run verify` is what makes the policy enforceable: every internal link,
canonical, sitemap entry and feed link is resolved to a file **by its exact
shape** — `/a/b/` is `a/b/index.html` and nothing else, `/a/b` is `a/b.html`
and nothing else — so a link and a file that disagree fail the build instead
of becoming a 404 on the host. The check used to accept either spelling,
which is precisely how a build under the wrong pairing passed every check
while linking to files that did not exist.

Want a different mix — flat project pages, say? Move that route between
`<name>.astro` and `<name>/index.astro`, teach its helper in `paths.ts` what
`paperPath()` knows, and the audit tells you about anything you missed.

## The asset baseline

`verification/asset-sha256.txt` pins the SHA-256 of everything under
`public/assets/`, and `verify` checks the built copies against it.

This is worth more than it looks on an academic site. A PDF you have published
is cited in other people's papers and indexed by Google Scholar, DBLP and your
institutional repository. Those URLs are permanent whether or not you meant
them to be — and they do not break through deliberate deletion. They break
through an image optimiser, a "clean up assets" commit, or a tool that rewrites
a file in place. None of those announce themselves.

When you genuinely add or replace an asset:

```bash
npm run baseline     # rewrites the file
git add public/assets verification/asset-sha256.txt
```

Commit both together, so the change and its authorisation are one commit.

## Sitemap and robots

`@astrojs/sitemap` emits `/sitemap-index.xml`, which points at `/sitemap-0.xml`
and any further pages. `src/pages/robots.txt.ts` is generated from `SITE.url`
and points at the index, so the two cannot drift apart.

`npm run verify` asserts that linkage rather than the filename: it reads the
`Sitemap:` line out of the built `robots.txt`, requires that file to exist in
`dist/`, follows it to every sitemap it lists, and resolves every URL in them
to a file on disk. A crawler learns the sitemap's address from `robots.txt`
and nowhere else, so a sitemap under a name `robots.txt` does not point at is
one nothing will read — and a `robots.txt` pointing at a file that was not
emitted is a 404 handed to every crawler. Rename the sitemap however you like,
as long as `robots.txt` still names it.

The integration lists pages Astro builds and nothing else, and a file in
`public/` is not one — so `astro.config.ts` walks `public/assets/pdf/`
(recursively, since PDFs are usually filed by year) and feeds the result to
`customPages`. Adding a paper needs no upkeep there.

That matters more on an academic site than it sounds: those PDFs are the single
highest-value thing to have indexed, because Google Scholar and DBLP find papers
that way. Both sites this template came from hand-rolled their entire sitemap
for this one capability.

## The og:image

`public/assets/img/og.png` is the card a link to your site renders with, and the
shipped one says "replace this" in 76px type so you notice. It is 1200×630,
which is what every platform crops from.

`SITE.ogImage` points at it. Set that to `null` and `BaseHead.astro` falls back
to `twitter:card: summary` — the small text-only card — because
`summary_large_image` with no image is a blank rectangle, which is worse than
the card it replaced.

For a per-page image, take an optional `image` prop through `BaseHead` the way
`title` and `description` already work.

## The two opt-in workflows

`update-github-metadata.yml` and `update-citations.yml` refresh
`src/data/github-metadata.json` and `src/data/citations.yml` and commit the
result. Both ship **on demand only**; uncomment the `schedule:` block to
enable.

Both need `secrets.PAT`, a fine-grained token with `contents: write` on the
repository. The built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not do: a push made with it
triggers no other workflow, so the data would land and the site would never
rebuild. Both workflows fail loudly rather than falling back, because the
failure that matters here is a green job whose result silently never ships.

The Scholar one additionally tolerates its own timeout. Scholar rate-limits
hard and has no API, so a run that cannot finish is routine — the counts stay
as they are until next time.

Neither is needed to build. Both output files are committed, which is what lets
a fresh clone build with no network, no token and nothing to rate-limit.

## Publishing the docs to the wiki

`docs/` in this repository is the source of these pages, and
`.github/workflows/docs.yml` copies it into the repository's GitHub wiki on every
push to `main` that touches `docs/**` — plus on demand from the Actions tab.

Four steps, once:

1. **Initialise the wiki.** Open the repository's **Wiki** tab and create one page
   by hand, with any content at all. The `<repo>.wiki.git` repository does not
   exist until somebody does this, and nothing can create it from the API — so
   before it exists the workflow's checkout fails with "repository not found".
   Whatever you write is overwritten on the first run.

2. **Create a CLASSIC personal access token.** Settings → Developer settings →
   Personal access tokens → **Tokens (classic)** → Generate new token (classic).
   Tick **`repo`** for a private or organisation repository; **`public_repo`** is
   enough for a public one.

   It has to be a classic token. GitHub's fine-grained permission list has **no
   wiki entry** — go through "Permissions required for fine-grained personal
   access tokens" and there is nothing to grant — so a fine-grained token that
   looks correctly scoped, `Contents: Read and write` and all, still cannot push
   to a wiki. Neither can the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, for the same reason.

3. **Add it as the repository secret `PAT`.** Settings → Secrets and variables →
   Actions → New repository secret, named exactly `PAT` — the same secret the two
   data-refresh workflows above read. One token covers all three: those two need
   no more than write access to the repository's contents, which `repo` includes.
   The wiki is therefore what decides _which kind_ of token to create.

4. **Push to `main`.** Or run "Publish the wiki" from the Actions tab.

The workflow checks for steps 1 and 3 before it does anything, and says which one
is missing. It has to, because they otherwise produce the same "repository not
found" from `actions/checkout` while wanting opposite fixes: one is "go and make a
wiki page", the other is "the token is the wrong kind".

One case those guards cannot catch, on a **public** repository: anonymous read of
the wiki is allowed, so a token with no write access clears both of them and fails
at the commit step with git's own "Write access to repository not granted". That is
still step 2 — a fine-grained token, most likely.

### What it does, and the one transformation

It **replaces** the wiki wholesale: everything but `.git` is removed, then
`docs/*.md` is copied in. `docs/` is the source of truth, so a page deleted there
has to disappear from the wiki, and a page somebody typed into the web UI is not
something to preserve. `_Footer.md` says so on every page.

The filenames are already wiki page names — flat, `Title-Case-With-Hyphens.md`,
which GitHub renders as "Title Case With Hyphens" — so there is nothing to
generate and no index to maintain. `_Sidebar.md` and `_Footer.md` are the wiki's
own conventions for the navigation column and the footer.

One `sed` reconciles the two readers. Inside `docs/` a link is written
`[Deploying](Deploying.md)`, because browsing `docs/` on GitHub is where most
people will read these pages and there a bare `](Deploying)` resolves to nothing.
On the wiki it is the other way round: `](Deploying.md)` opens a raw file view
rather than the page. So the `.md` comes off on the way in, and neither reader has
to be broken for the other.

The rewrite is deliberately narrow — the basename must start with an uppercase
letter and contain no slash — so a link that reaches outside the page set, such as
one to `../README.md`, is left exactly as written. An `#anchor` survives.

### If you adopted this template

**The workflow is pinned to the upstream repository and does nothing in yours.**
Its job carries

```yaml
if: github.repository == 'dfuchss/astro-studia'
```

so in a fork, or in a repository made with "Use this template" or `degit`, the job
is skipped cleanly: it never tries to push to somebody else's wiki and never fails
on a `PAT` secret you had no reason to set. `github.repository` rather than a fork
check, because an adopted copy of a template is not a fork and a fork check would
let it straight through.

A skipped job with no explanation reads like a broken one, so: that is the whole
reason. **To publish your own wiki**, change that one line to your own
`owner/repo` and follow the four steps above. Nothing else in the file needs an
edit.

`docs/` and the workflow are both yours now, and `npm run init` does not offer to
remove either. Six of these pages document code you now own and still have to
operate — the URL policy, the contrast floor, the contact schema, the checks your
CI runs — and the workflow publishes whatever is in `docs/`, so replacing the prose
leaves you a working documentation pipeline rather than one to rebuild. Inert with
a comment saying how to switch it on is a better default than gone: a file you did
not ask for costs one `if` line to read, whereas a pipeline you have to rebuild
from scratch costs an afternoon and is the thing people therefore never do.

The exception is [Removing features](Removing-Features.md). Its table is generated
from `scripts/features.mjs` by `scripts/gen-docs.mjs`, and `npm run init` offers to
delete both of those when it finishes — after which that table is a hand-maintained
file with a "do not edit by hand" marker on it. Either keep the generator or delete
the page; keeping the page without the generator is the one combination that is
simply wrong.
